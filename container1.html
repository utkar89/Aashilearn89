                Social media refers to online platforms where users can share information and connect with virtual
                communities through text, video, photos, and other content. As of 2024, social media had more than five
                billion global users, which is equal to more than 62% of the world population.

                <b>Social Media: Definition, Importance, Top Websites, and Apps</b><br>

                Origins and Evolution of Social Media
                Early social media platforms, such as MySpace and LiveJournal, were designed for people to
                connect with friends and family. MySpace, which allowed users to create personal profile pages
                and share information about themselves, became the first network to reach one million active
                monthly users in 2004.
                Our World in Data. “The Rise of Social Media.”

                LiveJournal, a platform where users could share journal-like entries with either public or
                private networks, reached over 2.5 million active accounts in 2005. <br>

                Social media use grew rapidly in the 2000s and early 2010s as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter)
                became popular. Like MySpace, Facebook users create profiles to share information about
                themselves, while other users leave comments. Initially used for socializing among college-age
                users, social media became popular with younger and older users.<br>

                In 2006, X's launch included its feed feature, where posts from accounts that a user followed
                were aggregated onto a single page.
                Facebook launched its own News Feed feature
                The news feed became a standard feature for many social media platforms. More users began
                posting links to external sites, where news stories, current events, and product pages could be
                shared with personal updates. Users could interact with each other's content, including liking,
                sharing, and commenting on posts.<br>
                During this time, social media platforms began adding business-specific profile pages and the
                ability to purchase targeted ads that other users would see, making them more business-friendly
                and increasing revenue for the platforms.<br>


                Social media users began spending more time scrolling through feeds and consuming daily news and
                commentary on current events. By 2024, just over half (54%) of adults in the U.S. said they get
                their news from social media "sometimes" or "often." Only 28% of U.S. adults say they "never"
                get the news from social media.

                Globally, only 22% of consumers get their news directly from news websites or apps, with younger
                news consumers the least likely to do so.<br>

                <b>How Social Media Is Used Today</b><br>
                As users continued to spend more time on social media sites, different types of social media
                platforms evolved. They can be broadly categorized as: <br>
                @Social networks:<br> Facebook, NextDoor<br>
                @Microblogging:<br> X, BlueSky, Mastodon, Threads<br>
                @Long-form blogging:<br> Substack, Ghost<br>
                @Professional networking:<br> LinkedIn, Behance, ResearchGate<br>
                @Video and photo sharing:<br> Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat<br>
                @Visual curation and search:<br> Pinterest, Houzz, DeviantArt<br>
                @Messaging:<br> WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, Marco Polo<br>
                @Community forums:<br> Reddit, Discord, Clubhouse<br>
                Platforms are oriented toward different uses and users. Some may be used purely for socializing,
                while others are oriented toward professional network building or job-hunting. Some platforms
                allow users to connect with others who share their political views or leisure hobbies.<br>

                @Many social media users are acting in a professional capacity. For instance:<br>

                @Actors and writers can use social media to connect with fans of their work<br>
                @Politicians use them to communicate with constituents and voters<br>
                @Nonprofit organizations may use them to promote charitable causes or collect donations<br>
                @Government agencies can use social media to communicate with the public during emergencies.<br>
                Posting content on social media, either sponsored by a business or funded through follower
                support, can also be a job in itself, separate from any outside work that the social media posts
                are promoting. These types of social media users are generally referred to as influencers or
                content creators. One in five social media users consider themselves professional content
                creators.<br>


                Social media is also an important form of marketing for many companies. Businesses use social
                media to identify and capitalize on consumer trends, engage with customers, collect consumer
                data, and pay for targeted advertising. Many also work with influencers, paying content creators
                to promote their products or services directly to the influencers' audience or followers.<br>

                <b>Advantages Explained </b>
                <b>Connectivity:</b><br> Social media platforms allow people to access global information and connect
                with friends
                and family at a distance. It can allow users to find niche communities around their interests or current
                needs, such as neighborhood forums or job searching. <br>
                <b>Build community:</b><br> Using social media is correlated to having more friends and a personal
                network with
                greater diversity, especially in emerging economies. Social media users are more likely to interact with
                those who are different from them across categories of income, political party, religion, or ethnicity.
                <br>
                <b>Affordable advertising:</b><br> Small businesses and creators can reach potential customers at low
                price points
                through targeted ads and influencer marketing. More than 200 million small businesses use Facebook.
                In 2024, online advertising, including social media and search advertising, accounted for 59% of global
                ad spending; that number is projected to grow to 61% in 2026 <br>

                <b></b>Disadvantages Explained</b> <br>
                <b> Disinformation/misinformation:</b> <br> The ease of sharing links and posts on social media can
                facilitate the
                spread of disinformation or misinformation. For instance, misinformation about Hurricane Helene hampered
                recovery efforts in the southern U.S. and harmed local communities impacted by the disaster in 2024.
                <br>
                <b> Sleep disruption:</b> <br> Social media use is correlated with less and poor quality sleep,
                especially among
                teens and young adults.
                Poor sleep is associated with a variety of health problems, including heart disease, high blood
                pressure, diabetes, obesity, and depression. <br>
                <b> Mental health impact:</b> <br> Research has also found a direct correlation between more social
                media use and
                higher rates of depression among teens.
                Other mental health concerns related to social media use include bullying, peer pressure, spreading
                rumors about peers and friends, and the creation of unrealistic expectations based on exposure to other
                people's lives. <br>

                <b> Child sexual abuse:</b> <br> In 2022, research found that more than one in six U.S. children
                experience sexual
                abuse online. Studies in other countries have found even higher rates. Social media can provide a
                platform for child sexual abuse and exploitation including grooming, stalking, sharing of explicit
                materials, revenge pornography, and nonconsensual sexting. <br>
